Process control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks form the backbone of the critical infrastructures that
make modern life possible, including the power transmission grid, power distribution, and
oil and natural gas pipelines. In recent years, these systems have been more closely
connected over computer networks, and have also been increasingly exposed to the outside
world. Unfortunately, this increased level of interconnectivity has not been met with
a corresponding improvement of security practices in this space. This thesis describes
a fuzz testing framework for the embedded devices that form the core of these critical networks.
Instead of use by security experts, as most frameworks are, this framework is intended for use
by end-users who, while technically savvy, may not have experience in security research or
vulnerability testing. It is hoped that this framework will assist device manufacturers and
facility operators in assessing and improving the security of their devices.
