Each year, thousands of heavy trucks are involved in traffic accidents, resulting in hundreds of thousands
to millions of dollars in property damage, medical expenses, and legal settlements. Lawsuits resulting from
these accidents hinge on determining the accidents' cause, the domain of accident reconstructionists. Since
the early 1990s, the trucks' Engine Control Modules (ECMs) have recorded information valuable to accident
reconstructionists. This information is extracted using the engine manufacturers' maintenance software in
a manner that does not protect the evidence from alteration. This dissertation describes a novel method
of extracting, and replaying, information from heavy truck engine control modules in a way that preserves
the source evidence to the greatest possible degree.
