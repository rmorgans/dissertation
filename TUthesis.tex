%
%     Please see the README.TUthesis file for information
%     on using the TUthesis template.
%
%              Modified November 2004
%
%  Summary of changes
%      1.  section, subsection and subsubsection replaced with
%          TUsection, TUsubsection and TUsubsubsection to correct
%          the Table of Contents.  This will add bold face and
%          italics to the appropriate places in the Table of Contents.
%      2.  Spacing added between first few items in Table of Contents.
%
%             Modified January 31, 2005
%
%  Summary of changes
%      1.  Correction made to code for the appendices so that the
%          automatic numbering is correct for subheadings, figures
%          and tables. TUappendix command added.
%
%             Modified August 15, 2005
%
%  Summary of changes
%
%      1.  Adjusted spacing after "by".
%      2.  Added Latex option so that margins are correct
%          for both PDFLaTeX and for LaTeX.
%
%             Modified June 14, 2007
%
%  Summary of changes
%
%      1.  Implementation of changes proposed by Mike Spanehower  and
%          Jesus Gonzalez to fix the page numbering problem when tables
%          and figures cover more than one page.
%      2.  Implemented a test page so that users can directly verify that
%          all of the margins are correct and made adjustments to current
%          margins.
%      3.  Numerous other minor changes to improve the compliance of the
%          TeX Thesis Template.
%
% This TUthesis Template uses the following two style files
%
%       TUthesis.sty
%       setspace.sty
%
% The TUthesis style file was created from scratch, but its
% construction would not be possible without extensive use of
% the Stanford Ph.D./Thesis style document.
%
% The TUthesis style and template files can be used for
% both theses and dissertations.
